## DESIGN STEPS

### STEP 1:
An Django application is created inside dataproject folder.

### STEP 2:
A python program is written to create a table to store and retrieve data.

### STEP 3:
The table is created with 6 fields in which the username field is made as PrimaryKey.

### STEP 4:
Then the project files migrated. A superuser is also created.

### STEP 5:
Now the server side program is executed .

### STEP 6:
The admin page of our website is accessed using username and password.

### STEP 7:
Records are added and saved in the table inside the database.



## PROGRAM

python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib import admin
class GitDatabase(models.Model):
    username_primary_key = models.CharField(max_length=30, help_text="User name must be unique", primary_key=True,unique=True)
    password = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    firstname = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    lastname = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    profile_photo = models.ImageField()
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=50,unique=True)
class GitAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('username_primary_key', 'password', 'firstname', 'lastname','profile_photo','email')
